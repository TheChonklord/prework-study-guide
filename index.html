        <ul>
          <li>Git pull origin main is very helpful.</li>
          <li>Git checkout will tell you which branch you're in.</li>
          <li>If the VS Code looks like something is slashed out that you actually need, sync it with the Git repo IMMEDIATELY.</li>
          <li>git add -A will "stage" all the changes I've made on the local repo before syncing with what's on Github.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "insert notes here" will commit said "staged" changes to the Github repo. If everything goes right, 
            when you do git pull origin main it will say "already up to date", and then you can push to the Github with 
            git push origin "insert branch name here"

          <li>JavaScript will make all the clickthrough elements on the webpage function as properly (assuming I code them properly)</li>
